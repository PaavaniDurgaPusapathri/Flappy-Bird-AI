# Flappy Bird AI

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can learn to play the Flappy Bird game without human control. The AI improves its gameplay over time by observing the environment and adjusting its decisions based on performance.

## 🎯 Objective
To train an AI model using machine learning so that it can play Flappy Bird automatically and perform better with each attempt.

## 🧠 Concept Used
- Machine Learning
- Neural Networks
- Evolutionary Algorithm (NEAT)

The AI starts with random behavior but learns to:
- Avoid hitting pipes
- Time its jumps correctly
- Survive longer with each generation of training

## 📂 Project Files Included

| **Presentation.ppt / .pptx** | PowerPoint presentation of the project |

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (optional, if code exists)
- NEAT Algorithm (if implemented)
- Pygame (if game simulation used)

## 👨‍💻 Developed By
Paavani Durga Pusapathri

## ✅ Conclusion
The project shows how AI can learn from trial and error. Over time, the AI improves its performance, demonstrating the concept of learning through evolution and adaptation.
