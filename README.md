# Flappy-Bird-AI
This project explores how an AI can learn to play Flappy Bird on its own using machine learning. The model is trained using the NEAT algorithm, allowing it to evolve better strategies over time. The AI observes game states, adapts, improves with each generation, and eventually plays without human control.
